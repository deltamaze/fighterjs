# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A fast-paced 3D third-person fighting game inspired by Star Wars Jedi Knight, Super Smash Bros, and Gunz: The Duel. The game features a damage accumulation system where higher damage leads to greater knockback, with the objective being to knock opponents off the map. The game emphasizes high-speed movement mechanics including dashing, dodging, and advanced techniques, rendered in a blocky art style similar to Vita Fighters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Game Mechanics

**User Story:** As a player, I want a damage accumulation system instead of traditional health points, so that battles become more intense as damage increases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player takes damage THEN the system SHALL increase their damage percentage
2. WHEN a player's damage percentage increases THEN their knockback distance SHALL increase proportionally
3. WHEN a player reaches maximum knockback threshold THEN they SHALL be knocked off the map
4. WHEN a player is knocked off the map THEN they SHALL lose the round

### Requirement 2: Movement System

**User Story:** As a player, I want fast-paced movement abilities including double jumping, dashing, and dodging, so that I can execute advanced movement techniques and combos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player presses jump THEN the character SHALL perform a jump
2. WHEN a player presses jump while airborne AND has not used double jump THEN the character SHALL perform a double jump
3. WHEN a player inputs dash command THEN the character SHALL perform a quick dash in the specified direction
4. WHEN a player inputs dodge command THEN the character SHALL perform an evasive dodge with brief invincibility frames
5. WHEN movement inputs are chained together THEN the system SHALL allow for advanced techniques similar to K-style gameplay

### Requirement 3: Combat System

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive combat mechanics with attacks that deal damage and knockback, so that I can engage in strategic fighting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player performs an attack THEN the system SHALL detect collision with opponents
2. WHEN an attack hits an opponent THEN the system SHALL apply damage and knockback based on current damage percentage
3. WHEN attacks are performed THEN they SHALL have appropriate startup, active, and recovery frames
4. WHEN players are in combat THEN the system SHALL provide visual and audio feedback for hits

### Requirement 4: 3D Environment and Camera

**User Story:** As a player, I want a 3D third-person perspective with a well-designed arena, so that I can navigate and fight effectively in three-dimensional space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the camera SHALL be positioned behind and above the player character
2. WHEN the player moves THEN the camera SHALL follow smoothly maintaining optimal viewing angle
3. WHEN players fight THEN the arena SHALL have clear boundaries and fall-off zones
4. WHEN a player approaches map edges THEN visual indicators SHALL warn of danger zones

### Requirement 5: Visual Style and Presentation

**User Story:** As a player, I want blocky, stylized graphics similar to Vita Fighters, so that the game has a distinctive and appealing visual identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN characters are rendered THEN they SHALL use blocky, low-poly geometric shapes
2. WHEN the environment is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain consistent blocky art style
3. WHEN effects are shown THEN they SHALL complement the overall visual aesthetic
4. WHEN the game runs THEN it SHALL maintain smooth performance with the chosen art style

### Requirement 6: Single Player Proof of Concept

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a single-player proof of concept with AI opponent, so that I can validate core mechanics before implementing multiplayer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN it SHALL support single-player mode against AI
2. WHEN playing single-player THEN the AI opponent SHALL demonstrate basic combat and movement behaviors
3. WHEN testing gameplay THEN all core mechanics SHALL be functional in single-player mode
4. WHEN the proof of concept is complete THEN it SHALL serve as foundation for future multiplayer implementation

### Requirement 7: Input and Controls

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive and intuitive controls for movement and combat, so that I can execute complex maneuvers effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player provides input THEN the system SHALL respond with minimal latency
2. WHEN multiple inputs are pressed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle input combinations correctly
3. WHEN advanced techniques are attempted THEN the input system SHALL support frame-precise timing
4. WHEN controls are configured THEN they SHALL be customizable for different player preferences
